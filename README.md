# MazeGame

This game was created as the final project for my very first programming course. The requirements were simple: make a game.
Beyond that, we had free reign.

At this point, my knowledge was incredibly basic. All I knew was how to make a console app in C#. I hadn't yet learned object oriented programming, no knowledge of classes.
Everything was created in a single file.

When I look back at this code, I physically cringe. But, it also shows me how far I've come.

It also reflects how I manage to think through a problem logically. Despite my limited technical knowledge, I managed to find a solution that worked. I thought through the logic of the issue and solved the problem with what I knew.
